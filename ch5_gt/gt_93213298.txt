233,469,669,469,669,493,233,493,Invitees stated the Newport hospitality tent was very
84,490,653,490,653,560,84,560,difficult to locate. Also, the Indy Lights Paddock area was not clearly identified Most Invitees were looking for the hospitality tent in a separate identified area away from the Paddock Brea and the Newport car transporter.
